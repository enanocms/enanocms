                                PHP code by Enano. If this option is enabled, and members of the Administrators group use these tags, Enano will
                                execute that code when the page is loaded. There are obvious potential security implications here, which should
                                be carefully considered before enabling this option.</p>

                                the site with you, you should enable this to allow extreme customization of pages.</p>
                             <p>Leave this option off if you are at all concerned about security – if your account is compromised and PHP embedding

                                embed Javascript and arbitrary HTML and CSS.</p>

      url_schemes_body: '<p>The URL scheme allows you to decide how the URLs to your Enano pages will look.</p>
                         <p>The first option (Standard URLs) works on any web server. You should select it if your server doesn\'t run Apache, or
                            if you are at all unsure of your server\'s configuration. With this scheme, URLs at your site will look like <tt>
                            http://yoursite.com/path-to-enano/index.php/Main_Page</tt>.</p>
                         <p>The second option, Small URLs, will be selected by default if Enano detects Apache. Small URLs are more friendly towards
                            search engines, but they don\'t work on very many non-Apache servers, or if PHP is set up through CGI on your server. Many
                            free and low-cost web hosts will configure PHP through CGI in order to keep your user account as the owner of any files that
                            Enano generates. With this scheme, URLs at your site will look like <tt>http://yoursite.com/path-to-enano/index.php/Main_Page</tt>.
                            </p>
                         <p>The last option, Tiny URLs, is the most friendly URL scheme for search engines, because your URLs won\'t have any special characters
                            at all in them. However, this only works if your webhost has configured Apache with support for mod_rewrite. Most of the time if your
                            host supports this you will see a listing for it in their feature matrix. None of the popular Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu,
                            Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux&trade;, Fedora, openSUSE&trade;, or CentOS) come with mod_rewrite enabled, so if you run a
                            home-brew server, you should consult your distribution\'s documentation for enabling mod_rewrite before selecting this option.
                            With this scheme, URLs at your site will look like <tt>http://yoursite.com/path-to-enano/Main_Page</tt>.</p>
