Enano CMS
Version 1.0.1
-----------------------------

Thanks for downloading Enano! If you're looking for an installation guide,
you can find it at <http://enanocms.org/Help:Installation>.

COPYRIGHT

We strongly believe in the idea of Free Software. Enano is released under the
GNU General Public License; see the file GPL included with this release for

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
-----------------------------

Please see <http://enanocms.org/Release_notes/1.0.1> for a list of changes in
this release.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS RELEASES
-----------------------------

This tarball includes an upgrade script that can migrate any previous version
of Enano to this one. Before you upload the contents of this tarball to your
server, be sure to delete the config.php and .htaccess files included with this
tarball, and back up these two files from your server. (.htaccess only needs to
be backed up if you're using the Tiny URLs option and/or you have Apache.)

EXPANDING YOUR SITE'S CAPABILITIES
-----------------------------

There is a gallery of plugins for Enano at
<http://enanocms.org/Category:Plugins>. It's not very full right now because
not every plugin has a page on the website yet, and some plugins still have
yet to be ported to work with some of the newer API changes.

GIVING YOUR SITE A NEW LOOK
-----------------------------

You can find more themes for Enano at <http://enanocms.org/Category:Themes>.
Again, we're still working on packaging up themes and creating pages for them,
so try to be patient. We have quite a few themes in the works.

GETTING SUPPORT
-----------------------------

Support for Enano is available via the Enano forums at
<http://forum.enanocms.org>. You can also use our IRC channel
(irc.freenode.net #enano) or purchase paid support via instant messaging for
US$20 an hour.

Have fun with Enano!
