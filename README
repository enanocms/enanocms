Most of the PHP code in Enano was written by Dan Fuhry. Some parts were borrowed
from other projects that are also released under Free licenses; see the various
files under the licenses/ directory included with this release for details.

If you are planning to make a commercial fork of Enano, all of the software and
libraries included with Enano are available under licenses that allow you to do
so; however, in compliance with the GPL, you must:

a) provide attribution to the Enano team in source code files and on the
   (renamed) Special:About_Enano page,
b) remove all instances of the word Enano and the Enano logo from your
   derivative work, with the exception of the following phrase, which must
   be shown on the (renamed) Special:About_Enano page:

    "The software used on this website was based on Enano CMS. Copyright
     (C) 2006-2007 Dan Fuhry."

   The words "Enano CMS" must link to the page <http://enanocms.org/>. You may
   (at your option) also include a notice of non-endorsement by the Enano
   Foundation, unless you're lucky enough to become an official fork
   maintainer.

c) Provide the complete source code for your modified version of Enano under
   the terms of the GNU General Public License, and
d) Include the complete and unmodified licenses/ directory, which contains
   licensing information for third-party libraries that Enano uses.

As permitted by the GPL, you may charge for the service of downloading Enano
from your server; however, you may not prevent others from distributing Enano
or any modified version.

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
-----------------------------

Please see <http://enanocms.org/Release_notes/1.0.3> for a list of changes in
this release.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS RELEASES
-----------------------------

This tarball includes an upgrade script that can migrate any previous version
of Enano to this one. Before you upload the contents of this tarball to your
server, you might want to delete the files config.new.php and .htaccess.new,
neither of which are needed if you are performing an upgrade.

EXPANDING YOUR SITE'S CAPABILITIES
-----------------------------

There is a gallery of plugins for Enano at
<http://enanocms.org/Category:Plugins>. It's not very full right now because
not every plugin has a page on the website yet, and some plugins still have
yet to be ported to work with some of the newer API changes.

GIVING YOUR SITE A NEW LOOK
-----------------------------

You can find more themes for Enano at <http://enanocms.org/Category:Themes>.
Again, we're still working on packaging up themes and creating pages for them,
so try to be patient. We have quite a few themes in the works. You can create
your own themes too; for more information, see Chapter V of the Enano
Administrator's handbook, at <http://docs.enanocms.org/Help:5>.

GETTING SUPPORT
-----------------------------

Before contacting support, have a look at the Enano Documentation at
<http://docs.enanocms.org/>. Most of Enano's features are documented with
step-by-step guides at this site; if you encounter a problem, then please
contact the Enano team as instructed below.

Support for Enano is available via the Enano forums at
<http://forum.enanocms.org>. You can also use our IRC channel
(irc.freenode.net #enano) or purchase paid one-on-one support via instant
messaging for US$20 an hour.

Have fun with Enano!
