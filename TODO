Enano Banshee - TODO
------------------------------------------

[ ] COPPA compliance
[x] Add in Moderators group
    [x] Create default ACL rule for mods
[x] Fix invalid HTML in SF.net logo
[ ] Clean up the wikitext parser - a lot. It needs some serious work.
    We need a way to detect whether the text is mostly HTML, and if
    so, then leave stuff like automatic adding of <p> and <br /> out
    of the picture. Continue to parse wikilinks.
[x] Add a system_group column and if it's set to 1, give (at least) a
    stern warning before deleting the group. Maybe disable the delete
    button altogether?
[x] SQL exporter: fix structure exporting when an auto column is defined
    and it's a named key (see pun_search_words)
[x] Possibly add these fields: AIM, Yahoo, MSN, XMPP messenger icons, then homepage, location, occupation, hobbies, allow public e-mail display
    [ ] Put it in a user_extra table and have an option to enable or disable these fields in the admin panel
    [Y] Delay until RC3 or Banshee?
    [ ] When added, put a box on the user page that shows the information
[x] Fix "this page" bug in ACL editor
    [x] The problem itself got fixed BUT there seem to be deeper problems related to scope selection
        This needs to be FIXED and WORKING PERFECTLY in Banshee!
[x] Change the string shown on a successful re-auth into elevated privileges
    [x] ...and write a function that converts a numeric userlevel to a string
[x] Make Special:Login remember parameters (target level, target page) even on auth fail
[x] Register users_extra table in system tables list (already done?)
[x] Trigger form submit on press of enter in Dynano login form
[ ] Rewrite the change theme dialog - it's archaic code that hasn't changed since beta 1!
    [ ] This should be the next-to-last step in phasing out the JWS code, which should be removed in the first 1.1 alpha
[ ] Get the new page ID cleaner code working 100% perfectly - this is the core of Enano and should be completely bug free


Enano Clurichaun - TODO
------------------------------------------

[x] Finish rewriting userprefs panel
    Remaining components:
    [x] Signature
    [x] Real name
[x] When a user's level is set to Moderator or Administrator, automatically add them to the respective group
[x] Fix de-authentication button in admin panel
[x] Merge newer artwork into installer; make trademark notices
[x] Case-insensitive usernames for login
[x] Mass e-mail function in admin panel

Enano Leprechaun - TODO
------------------------------------------
[x] Make a frontend for creating/managing usergroups in the admin panel
[x] Make a frontend for group mods to add/remove group members in a new special page
[x] Create ACL editing frontends - preferably a "Manage access" button on every page and in the user admin panel
    [x] Need no-Javascript version of ACL editor
[x] Make absolutely everything check for the proper access - do a complete audit of index.php and pageutils.php
    [x] Also need to check RenderMan::getPage, and require view_source privileges to get pages without wiki
        formatting or without PHP/HTML code
    [x] Check permissions for uploaded files and category editing - if the category is protected and the user doesn't have
        even_when_protected rights, lock down the category from adding/removing articles
        [x] For this to work, need SessionManager's ability to calculate effective permissions for a page implemented
[x] Update installation schema to create the default Everyone, Administrators, and Moderators groups and insert the
    admin user into Moderators and Administrators
[x] Update the upgrade schema - last point plus add in table creation for e_groups, e_group_members, and e_acl
[x] AJAX: Access control list editor
    [x] Write a template parsing class in Javascript
    [x] Use JSON to transport template data, permission types, etc. to the javascript client
    [x] Use JSON to send the updated permissions back to the server
[x] File uploads: Rewrite Special:UploadFile to work with new storage system
[x] Implement password reset
[x] Fix empty group bug in javascripted ACL editor

Delayed:

[x] REWRITE Special:Preferences - settle for nothing less than perfect on this one! (DELAYED until RC2 - put password reset issues in known bugs)
[ ] Implement ACL presets (DELAYED until RC2)

Website-related:

[ ] Enano website: add versioning rules page (like linux: x.y.z: x is major release, y is minor, and z is revision; if y is odd then its a beta)
[ ] Enano website: create codename tracker page (PARTIALLY DONE)
